3. risk assesment :
  a. this paragraph wasn't clear enough to me becuse I used web routes not api for the website , so
   to make it easier I used seeder data and php unit test for authentication.
   =================================================================
   Create a PHP-based API server responsible for mocking authentication of the employee and
   the clients, and for serving mock data, via REST API.
   
  b. I faced some chalenges like incompatable versions like (php, nodejs, npm issues) to be updated with laravel 11 and laravel breeze


  finally I wish MØ© work gets your approval .
